I am passionate about telling stories that speak truth to power and resonate with people. Though writing has been my focus, I am also an editor and have experience in digital and multimedia reporting.</p>
                    <p class="lead"> I received a bachelor's in journalism from the Medill School at Northwestern University, where I'm currently working on a master's in journalism. I am originally from New Orleans, Louisiana, and I have reported on events in Chicago, Washington, DC, and the Crescent City itself.

                                    <p class="mb-5">This story originally appeared in North by Northwestern's <a href="https://www.northbynorthwestern.com/eating-disorders-2/"> winter 2020 issue</a>.</p>

                                    	<p><em>CONTENT WARNING: This story discusses the experiences of students dealing with eating disorders.</em></p>
                                    <p>Gisel* was out of options. Early winter quarter of 2017, Gisel was completing a partial hospitalization program in Chicago for an eating disorder when she received an email from Northwestern Residential Services. Because she was not a full-time student while going through treatment, she needed to vacate her dorm. Terrified, Gisel went to Residential Services and asked them to let her stay. Moving home wasn’t an option for her. But the person she needed to speak to wasn’t in the office, so she had 48 hours to figure it out on her own.</p>

<p>“That was probably the worst experience I’ve had in Northwestern, thinking I was going to lose my housing,” Gisel says. “I was 18. I didn’t know anyone. I had no friends.”</p>

<p>Finally, one of Gisel’s psychiatrists filed an emergency exception for her to stay in student housing. The University accepted. </p>

<p>Northwestern students with eating disorders often need to navigate a complex web of resources and regulations, with little help from the University.</p>

<p>In general, college students are susceptible to eating eating disorders. About 13 percent of female college students and about 4 percent of male students struggle with eating disorders, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH).</p>

<p>But advocates say that on-campus resources for students with eating disorders are sparse. Northwestern isn’t unique in sometimes providing insufficient resources: According to the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA), only 22 percent of college students said there were year-round screening resources on campus. But Northwestern’s productivity culture and intense academics can worsen symptoms of an eating disorder.</p>

<b>The pressure to perform</b>

<p>Supporting students with eating disorders can be particularly challenging at a place like Northwestern, according to Amanda Mueller, senior assistant director of Residential Life. </p>

<p>“I think sometimes the pace of Northwestern, met with some of those pressures of achieving academically, the social pressures that exist in various spaces, that the university can allow [eating disorders] sometimes to go unseen because they look like signs of stress, of someone not eating or struggling with illness or food poisoning,” Mueller says, though she argues this trend can be seen at universities across the country. </p>

<p>Third-year Isabella Noe, who is in recovery from an eating disorder, adds that Northwestern’s intense academics can exacerbate symptoms of eating disorders, which are often about trying to maintain control. </p>

<p>“It’s [that] feeling of not being enough and also feeling really out of control sometimes because you have all of these assignments; you have all of these classes; you have all these extracurriculars that you’ve dedicated your time to,” she says. “And it can be really hard to find enough control in your life because that’s what eating disorders are about.”</p>


<p>Throughout her time at Northwestern, Gisel has generally only taken two or three classes a quarter, because she struggled to manage her anxiety and eating disorder. When she was in treatment, she only took one class each quarter.</p>

<p>“I [wasn’t] used to regulating all these emotions because they’ve been starved out for so long that I couldn’t manage more than two classes. Three was a stretch,” she says.</p>


<p>Because of how few classes she had taken, the school put Gisel on academic probation. While she thought she could take three classes the next quarter (the minimum required to remain a full-time student), Gisel had to take four classes to get taken off probation, as mandated by the University. </p>


<p>Unwilling to explain her circumstances to Northwestern, Gisel took four classes for one quarter, but struggled to keep up and was barely able to come off probation. Though she hasn’t been on academic probation since, she will have to stay for an extra year to complete her degree.</p>

<b>Getting help</b>

<p>Trying to find help on campus for disordered eating can be challenging. Those struggling with eating disorders usually have to find outside treatment options, as Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) has notoriously struggled to fully meet students’ needs.</p>

<p>Noe says she had struggled with an unhealthy relationship with food her whole life, but the stress of applying to college senior year exacerbated a cycle of binge eating and purging. However, it wasn’t until the end of her first year of college that she began seeing a therapist.</p>

<p>Noe says she would not have been able to receive any treatment if she weren’t a sexual assault survivor, since she found her therapist through Porchlight Counseling Services, which offers free counseling to survivors of sexual assault. Porchlight limits their services to 20 free sessions, and since Noe hit that limit, she can no longer afford counseling, she says.</p>

<p>Dr. Renee Rienecke, an adjunct associate professor at the Feinberg School of Medicine and director of research at the Eating Recovery Center, a treatment center in Chicago, stresses the importance of having a support system in place for students in treatment for eating disorders.</p>

<p>“[Universities] should know warning signs and symptoms and things like that,” Rienecke says. “I think universities can play an important role in identifying and getting someone into treatment.”</p>

<p>CAPS operates the Eating Concerns Assessment and Treatment Team, a group of psychiatrists and dieticians that work together to treat students with eating disorders. According to their website, the team provides assessment services to determine if a student has an eating disorder, and consultation services to Northwestern community members worried about a student. For long-term treatment, students need to look outside the University.</p>

<p>In Gisel’s first year, she joined the rowing team. When she mentioned an earlier diagnosis of an eating disorder on the health information form most club and varsity athletes are required to fill out, Northwestern’s Health Service referred her to CAPS.</p>

<p>At the first appointment, a psychiatrist told her that they couldn’t handle her needs. She met with them twice more before they referred her to outside therapy. In January of that year, she began commuting daily to a hospital downtown for inpatient care, taking one class in the morning before she left campus. She remained in inpatient treatment for eight months.</p>

<p>During this time, CAPS stopped communicating with her entirely. Afraid to tell her parents, she was left on her own. No one explained to Gisel how medical leave worked.</p>

<p>It wasn’t until this year, at the suggestion of her therapist, that she received accommodations from AccessibleNU for anxiety stemming from anorexia nervosa.</p>

<p>“I completely don’t trust any of the Northwestern resources, and that’s largely because I had such a bad experience,” she says. “I think it made things worse my freshman year just because I felt so isolated and like a ghost walking around on campus, like no one knew what was happening.”</p>

<p>CAPS declined a request to comment for this story.</p>

<b>Making accommodations</b>

<p>Even for students who do receive treatment, Northwestern’s bureaucracy is often difficult to navigate. As a result, students sometimes don’t receive accommodations that would help them recover.</p>

<p>During her first year, Noe asked to be exempted from the meal plan. As someone struggling with binge-eating, the buffet-style dining halls, with a variety of food available but not enough healthy options, were overwhelming and stressful. Part of coping with an eating disorder, she says, is finding healthy ways of controlling food, from always eating at the same time or knowing all of their ingredients in meals. The dining halls aren’t always conducive to those coping mechanisms.</p>

<p>When she asked for the exemption, Northwestern wanted her to provide a diagnosis from a doctor and documentation. Noe wasn’t comfortable sharing that information.</p>

<p>“That [felt] really invalidating and something that, as a freshman in college starting in a new place, I did not want to disclose,” Noe says. “Where I am now, I would probably fight that harder. But that’s also so far into recovery.”</p>

<p>AccessibleNU will work with students who have learning difficulties stemming from an eating disorder. In addition, because students registered with AccessibleNU receive priority registration, students in recovery from an eating disorder can arrange their schedules to allow for consistent meal times every day. </p>

<p>Though many students have had largely positive experiences with AccessibleNU, not everyone can use their resources. The office usually requires documentation before they create an accommodation plan with students, though students can still ask for exceptions to this rule, according to their website. </p> 

<p>“I get it; they want to make sure that people aren’t abusing that resource,” Noe says. “But at the same time, that’s a really elitist thing to expect from a country that does not have universal healthcare or anything close.”</p>

<p>Gisel says that, at first, she struggled to overcome the shame of having an eating disorder and feeling like she “deserved” accommodations. But balancing her recovery while taking classes has been much easier once she received them.</p>

<p>“I told [a staff member at AccessibleNU] at the end of our meeting, ‘It’s weird to be treated like a human by Northwestern, to be treated as a person with feelings,’” she says.</p>

<b>Before a crisis</b>
<p>Many organizations and campus offices create programming to prevent eating disorders or guide students into treatment before disordered eating becomes dangerous, but there’s a disconnect between the needs of struggling students and available resources.</p>  

<p>Resident Assistants (RAs), for example, receive training to learn how to look for signs of eating disorders in their residents, according to Mueller. They also learn how to report and intervene in a crisis situation, using active listening and open-ended questions. RAs are encouraged to report any concerning behavior they see to residential directors, professional staff members with more extensive training who live in some dorms.</p>

<p>“When we do training with RAs in-house around intentional interactions or something, we call the expectation of RAs to have conversations and get to know every member of their community, whether it’s a floor or a building,” Mueller says.</p>

<p>But she also says RAs usually have 35 residents, while some have up to 50. It can be difficult for them to establish relationships with all of their residents. Gisel says she didn’t know her RA’s name freshman year, and they never spoke while she was in treatment.</p>

<p>Spotting an eating disorder can be difficult, according to NEDA. Those struggling with an eating disorder have varied symptoms, including a preoccupation with food or weight, withdrawal from friends and usual activities and mood swings, among others. These signs may go unnoticed in many college students, according to Rienecke.</p>

<p>Northwestern provides few educational opportunities to help students recognize the signs of eating disorders in their peers. There is no programming during Wildcat Welcome specifically devoted to disordered eating. And while RAs can create a bulletin board or hold a meeting to explain the resources for students with eating disorders, they are not required to, Mueller says.</p>

<p>This year’s Body Acceptance Week, a CAPS-run program that ran from February 23 - 28 to promote healthy body image, included seminars from University dieticians on food positivity and mindful eating, in addition to stations around campus for students to pick up pamphlets about body image. This can be difficult for students who are struggling because it requires openness about eating issues.</p>

<p>“There is a certain level of confidentiality that you want when you’re dealing with something like that. You don’t want to just show up to the eating disorder club,” Noe says. “Having such big public events that are supposed to support body positivity or body acceptance probably isn’t the most effective way to [help students with eating disorders].”</p>

<b> Possible Solutions </b>

<p>Some students in recovery from eating disorders found healing outside of Northwestern’s programming.</p>

<p>Gisel and Noe both participate in Northwestern’s <i>Burlesque</i> show, for example, which produces sex-positive and body-positive performances. They say Burlesque has helped them feel more comfortable in their bodies.</p>

<p>But mental health advocates argue that the University resources need to be adjusted to support students struggling with their mental health, that students should be able to find support directly through the University.</p>

<p>Part of that task is to reach a wide range of students, says Tejas Sekhar, co-director of ResilientNU, a student group that teaches mental wellness workshops but does not provide group therapy. He says they can only reach so many students that want to learn about mental wellness.</p>

<p>In order to do this, he argues that Northwestern should assign all students a health and wellness advisor, whose job is to help students navigate mental health resources on campus.</p>

<p>“You set foot on campus, and there’s your designated person to be able to talk about this kind of stuff,” Sekhar says. “It’s not necessarily therapy, but they could be like a real person, physical guide to guide you to other resources.”</p>

<p>Rienecke also notes that involving parents and other family members is crucial to treating eating disorders. Treatment is often most effective when family is involved, she says, because those who struggle with eating disorders are often ambivalent about getting treatment because those illnesses are “ego-syntonic,” meaning those who suffer from them may not recognize their severity.</p>

<p>“Eating disorders are really dangerous,” she says. “And so I think to leave someone alone in going through therapy on their own is not particularly helpful. Getting parents involved, no matter where [they] live, is really important in ...getting a college student into treatment.”</p>

<b>A path toward healing</b>

<p>While the recovery process is ongoing for Noe and Gisel, both have found ways to cope with their eating disorder on campus.</p>

<p>Gisel stayed on the rowing team and says her teammates have supported her throughout her time in treatment. Noe has been able to cope with her eating disorder partially through theatre. Her freshman year, while she was struggling with her eating disorder, she participated in a show called <i>Defining Beauty</i>.</p>

<p>“That was sort of the first time that I had ever really opened up about having an eating disorder, feeling sort of trapped in that and out of control,” Noe says. “I think that doing that show was in its own way a very healing process.”</p>

<p>Now that she lives off-campus, Noe cooks her own food, which she says has been instrumental to her recovery. She loves going to the grocery store and picking out ingredients for her meals, which she couldn’t do while she was on the meal plan for her first two years at Northwestern.</p>

<p>For Gisel, she’s more willing to accept help and work with her therapists to manage her eating disorder, which has been helpful in her ongoing recovery.</p>

<p>“It sucks to continue to struggle, but I think I’m a little more gracious with myself about it now than I would have been this time my freshman year,” she says.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-5">Poppy Tooker’s latest book,<em><a href="https://www.octaviabooks.com/event/poppy-tooker-drag-queen-brunch"> Drag Queen Brunch</a></em>, was inspired by a ghost spotting.</p>
                                    <p><a href="https://www.newsweek.com/herstory-drag-julian-eltinge-rupauls-drag-race-1415489?slide=1">Julian Eltinge </a>, a popular actor from the early 20th century who frequently appeared in drag under the name “Vesta Tilly,” would regularly dine at what was then known as Begue’s in the French Quarter. Eltinge’s memory lives on at Tujague’s, which now occupies the Begue building, and occasionally his ghost has been spotted at the restaurant.</p>
                                    <p>After Tooker published her book <em><a href="https://tujaguesrestaurant.com/cookbook/">Tujague’s Cookbook</a></em> in 2015, she learned about Eltinge’s ghost. Inspired, she decided to host a pop-up drag brunch at Tujague’s to benefit <a href="https://crescentcarehealth.org/">CrescentCare</a>, what used to be known as the NO/AIDS Task Force. Soon, she was hosting drag brunches at Tujague’s and other restaurants regularly.</p>
                                    <p>“Three years ago, I made a joke about, 'oh well, that has to be the next book, The Drag Queen Brunch Book,' and people would say to me, 'Poppy, that's not really a joke. That's really a good idea,’” Tooker told <em>Adore</em>. Thus, <em>Drag Queen Brunch</em> was born.</p>
                                    <p>The book, which is set to release today, is filled with stunning photographs, delicious recipes, and a vibrant history of drag in New Orleans. Tying together two New Orleans traditions, the new release also blends the historic and the contemporary with ease. It features 60 brunch recipes from landmarks like Brennan’s and Antoine’s as well as recipes from trendy new joints like MoPho and Toups South. The 16 drag queens that are profiled range from older queens who focus on glamour to newer queens who use drag as a form of political and social expression.</p>
                                    <p>Tooker has been working with drag queens for decades. At the height of the AIDS crisis, in the 1980s, Tooker and her friend Joe Middleton were friends with a group of drag queens known as The Demented Women.</p>
                                    <p>As they watched their friends suffer and die from the disease, Middleton, who had previously been a professional chef, became a Franciscan priest and worked at the Lazarus House, ministering to those dying of HIV/AIDS. Tooker began working with the NO/AIDS Task Force, and she and Middleton remained friends until his death three years ago. She describes him as the “co-author” of <em>Drag Queen Brunch</em>.</p>
                                    <p>“The book is really intended to honor and remember Joe and all of our all of our drag queen friends who we lost back in the 80s, when we lost a whole generation of brilliant, talented, and wonderful people,” Tooker said. “There are many, many hands that have gone into making this book and not all of them are here on Earth.” A portion of the proceeds from the book will be donated in perpetuity to CrescentCare.</p>
                                    <p>Sam Hanna, an esteemed local culinary photographer, took the photographs for the book. He previously worked with Tooker on her two <a href="https://www.poppytooker.com/books"> most recent books</a>: <em>Pascal’s Manale Cookbook</em> and <em>Tujague’s Cookbook</em>. In addition, Wayne Phillips of the Louisiana State Museum wrote the history of drag in New Orleans for the book.</p>
                                    <p>Tooker hopes that <em>Drag Queen Brunch</em> will expand readers’ knowledge about drag in New Orleans. She calls the book “charmed,” as all those involved with the creation of it will benefit, from CrescentCare to the drag queens profiled in the book.</p>
                                    <p>“I'm hoping it broadens horizons, opens minds, and helps make everybody understand that drag is really just about beauty and glamour and magic,” Tooker said. “I'm so wrapped up in that. It's a charming tradition as old as the hills in New Orleans.”</p>

                                    <p> <em>This story was reported through the Medill Israel Program, with Professor Bob Rowley, in March 2019. It has not been published. </em></p>
                                   <p class="mb-5">ARIEL, West Bank — In the middle of the West Bank, about 14 miles east of the Green Line and about 13 miles from Shiloh, sits Ariel, the fourth-largest Israeli settlement in the West Bank. Home to 20,000 residents and 15,000 university students, Ariel is a quiet, peaceful city nestled in the rolling hills.</p>
                                   <P>Yet Ariel is one of the reasons that there is no peace in the region, according to many political activists and advocates.</P>
                                   <p>“In order for [a peace agreement] in the region, three things need to happen: two willing and capable leaders, a defensible border and the removal of settlements,” said Joel Singer, former legal counsel to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and a participant in the Oslo Accords in 1993.</p>
                                   <p>Israeli settlements in the West Bank have long been a thorn in the side of peace negotiators.</p>
                                   <p>Palestinians view these settlements as illegal. <a href="https://www.icrc.org/en/doc/resources/documents/misc/634kfc.htm">Under international law</a>, citizens of an occupying power cannot move into occupied territory, and the occupying power cannot seize property from occupied persons.</p>
                                   <p>However, many Israelis view the settlements as crucial to the security of Israel. They point to Netanya, a large city on the western coast of Israel, that is only about nine miles from the “Green Line,” the official border between Israel and the West Bank, named for the green pen it was drawn in.</p>
                                   <p>“In a war, nine miles is nothing,” said Natalie Zacks, Director of Communications for the Ariel Development Fund (ADF), a group that works to raise funding and awareness for Ariel.</p>
                                   <p><a href="https://www.haaretz.com/.premium-experts-to-pm-settlements-could-trigger-more-violence-1.5174708">Many security experts disagree with this assessment</a>, saying that the settlements in fact make Israel more vulnerable, as they are seen as provocations against the Palestinians, who have long been vocal about their opposition to the settlements.</p>
                                   <p>For residents of Ariel, however, enemies and security threats are far from their minds. Many residents here live and work side-by-side with their Arab neighbors. In Ariel’s thriving industrial center, Israeli Jews and Arab Palestinians are afforded equal opportunities in the factories, according to the ADF. However, all of the factories are Israeli-owned and operated.</p>
                                   <p>“All people that live here, all of the Israelis that live here, we’re looking for peace,” said Eliana Passentin, a resident of a small settlement community outside of Ariel and a member of the Mateh Binyamin Regional Council, a governing body for the Israeli settlements in the area.</p>
                                   <p><a href="https://www.jpost.com/Breaking-News/Shooting-reported-near-West-Bank-settlement-of-Ariel-583697">This harmony was interrupted last month </a>, when an Israeli soldier and two Israeli citizens, including a local rabbi, were killed in a terror attack at a junction just outside of Ariel. The event rocked the small community and brought the issues of security to the forefront of everyone’s minds.</p>
                                   <p>Most Israeli settlers tend to be ideological hard-liners who believe Israel has the right to all of the territory in the region. Often, they choose to live in settlements to be closer to places of religious significance, such as ancient Shiloh.</p>
                                   <p>As such, many don’t believe that the Palestinians have any claim over the land. They also see the Palestinian Authority as the sole instigator of violence in the region and the primary opponent of peace.</p>
                                   <p>“They lost the [Israeli War of Independence] that we absolutely did not want to take part in,” Passentin said. “And they lost their right to that two-state solution.”</p>
                                   <p>Ariel was founded under the auspices of the Israeli government, and in 1985, the Israeli government recognized it as an official settlement, not just an outpost, which means that Israel will not surrender it in any peace negotiations, according to Zacks. This could prove problematic if negotiations do pick up again, since Ariel sits right in the middle of the West Bank.</p>
                                   <p>In the past, negotiators have attempted to arrange a “land swap” between the Palestinians and the Israelis, where Israel is allowed to annex some of the settlements in the West Bank, as long as the Palestinian Authority is given land comparable in size to the annexed settlements somewhere else.</p>
                                   <p>Since most settlements are near the Green Line, it wouldn’t be too difficult for Israel to annex some of those settlement blocks and give the Palestinian Authority other land near the border, possibly in the Negev Desert, which is less populated.</p>
                                   <p>But since Ariel is in the middle of the West Bank, far from the Green Line, it will be difficult to annex it. While Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised in the last election campaign that he would begin annexing Israeli settlements once elected, annexing Ariel is much easier said than done.</p>
                                   <p>“You can’t have a country with unclear borders. Having pockets of land be Palestinian and pockets be Israeli is not defensible and will not allow for peace,” Singer said.</p>
                                   <p>Israeli settlements have come into play in other ways throughout Israeli history as well. In 1978, when Israel was negotiating peace with Egypt, they surrendered the Sinai Peninsula to the Egyptians after having won it in the Six Day War in 1967. According to Singer, the settlers in the Sinai Peninsula were evacuated in the very last phase of the peace plan, in order to give people time to prepare. Still, evacuating setters proved difficult for the government.</p>
                                   <p>In 2005, when the Israeli government decided to evacuate all of the settlements in the Gaza Strip, many families waited until the absolute last day to evacuate, because they didn’t want to leave their homes, despite living in an area of great violence and strife.</p>
                                   <p>According to Singer, one of his primary regrets was not halting the expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip while peace negotiations were occurring. There are now close to 500,000 Israeli settlers living in the West Bank, according to Singer, which will make evacuation difficult. Leaving the settlers there is not an option, according to him. And since peace seems further away than ever, it’s likely that the settlements will only continue to grow.</p>
                                   <p>For its residents, Ariel is their home and they can’t imagine living anywhere else.  It’s the place where they’ve raised their families, and it’s a place of deep religious and spiritual connection. Most settlers refer to the West Bank as “Judea and Samaria,” the Biblical name for the territories, as an homage to the area’s religious significance.</p>

                                    <p><em>This story was reported through Journalism 390: Native American Environmental Issues and the Media, with Professor Patty Loew, in December 2018. It has not been published. </em>
                                    <p class="mb-5">Though Alissa Baker-Oglesbee doesn’t live in Oklahoma anymore, she still remembers the Dollar Generals.</p>
                                    <p>“Dollar General Corp. seems to really almost have kind of a predatory relationship on these rural communities, where they will build stores on the outlying borders of these very rural towns and they have just enough food,” Baker-Oglesbee, a member of the Cherokee Nation and a native of Jay, Okla., said.</p>
                                    <p>While the nearest grocery store can be over an hour away for people in her community, convenience stores like Dollar General that sell processed foods and other cheap groceries are closer to town and much cheaper, according to Baker-Oglesbee. The result is that many residents of the area spend most of their money dedicated to food at the convenience stores, rather than on produce and other healthful foods that are more expensive and less accessible.</p>
                                    <p>Jay is what’s known as a “food desert,” a geographical area devoid of affordable fresh produce and healthful foods. <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-access-research-atlas/go-to-the-atlas/">There are two ways that an area can be designated a food desert, according to the USDA</a>: if there isn’t a place that sells healthful food within one mile of the area and residents lack vehicle access, or if residents have vehicle access but there isn’t a place that sells healthful foods within ten miles of the area. In Jay, many residents lack access to a vehicle, which is why the USDA calls it a food desert.</p>
                                    <p>The problem of food deserts is widespread across the United States, but it’s particularly bad in Native American communities: <a href="http://www.nativepartnership.org/site/DocServer/2017-PWNA-NPRA-Food-Insecurity-Project-Grow.pdf?docID=7106">at least 60 Native American reservations struggle with food insecurity</a>, according to Partnership with Native Americans, a nonprofit that advocates for Native communities.</p>
                                    <p>“It’s more about keeping that conversation alive that we do have discrepancy in the quality of food that people have, so no longer is it just okay to just fill someone’s belly,” said Joy Schelble, a federally recognized tribal extension program educator who works with the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa (also known as Ojibwe) in northern Wisconsin. “I definitely look at food insecurity as an issue of quality as much as of hunger.”</p>
                                    <p>While the federal government provides food commodities to low-income Natives living on reservations, the quality of those commodities isn’t very good, according to Schelble and Baker-Oglesbee. It’s often flour, sugar and other processed goods that are cheap but low in nutritional value.</p>
                                    <p>“That’s where fry bread came from, because it was just something you can make with these crappy commodities,” said Baker-Oglesbee, referring to the deep-fried dough bread that is stereotypically associated with Native Americans.</p>
                                    <p>Lack of access to healthful foods combined with the low-quality commodities contribute to poor health in Native communities: 42 percent of Native Americans are obese, and Native Americans have the highest rate of Type 2 Diabetes of any demographic in the United States, according to Partnership with Native Americans. Native Americans are more than twice as likely as other Americans to die from diabetes.</p>
                                    <p>In addition to the negative health effects, food commodities are damaging to Native communities for another reason: they erode the traditional food systems of native people, according to Dylan Jennings, Director of Public Information for the Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission and elected tribal council member for the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa.</p>
                                    <p>“When we’re talking about our diets from a long time ago compared to today, it’s pretty concerning,” Jennings said. “There’s a vast difference between how we used to eat and how we eat now.”</p>
                                    <p>Not only is processed food a far cry from the typical diets of Native people pre-colonization, the agricultural systems that produce the food we eat today is remarkably different from Native agricultural practices.</p>
                                    <p>Food sovereignty is the right of people to healthy and culturally appropriate food that’s produced through methods that they define. The term was first coined in 1996 by <a href="https://viacampesina.org/en/">La Via Campesina, the international peasant’s movement</a>. Across the country, Native American nations are engaging in food sovereignty efforts, trying to get back to the foods and practices of their ancestors.</p>
                                    <p>“The food sovereignty movement that we’re seeing in [Native] communities is really about getting back to utilizing the things that we have always used,” Jennings said. “There’s been things in our history that have gotten us off track and [we’re] trying to get back to that old way that we used to live by.”</p>
                                    <p>At the Bad River reservation in Wisconsin, there are several initiatives to promote food sovereignty. They combine modern organic food production and traditional Ojibwe food practices in order to sustainably produce fresh fruits, vegetables, herbs and medicinal plants year-round. These practices include high tunnel greenhouses and orchards as well as foraging and spearfishing, a traditional practice of the Ojibwe.</p>
                                    <p>Education and youth outreach are also important parts of the food sovereignty efforts. In her role as a tribal extension program educator, Schelble works with youth on the Bad River reservation, teaching them about nutrition as well as traditional agricultural practices. One of the high tunnel greenhouses is designed for educational purposes.</p>
                                    <p>In addition to programs regarding food, the Bad River Ojibwe are trying to return to their recreational traditions as well: Community members have begun playing <em>baaga‘adowe</em>, a form of lacrosse that the Ojibwe played for hundreds of years.</p>
                                    <p>Bad River officials hope that these efforts will restore vitality on the reservation and the surrounding areas.</p>
                                    <p>“The old school way that people would play [<em>baaga‘adowe</em>] here would be on fields of were sometimes three to five miles long. And the game would continue for days on end,” Schelble said. “And now we have people that are living 20 years less than their white neighbor.”</p>
                                    <p>In Oklahoma, the Cherokee nation also has many food sovereignty projects. Unlike the Ojibwe, the Cherokee were historically a farming people. Because of their strong ties to agriculture, the tribe keeps a bank of traditional seeds that the Cherokee people would use for food, medicine or crafting. Members of the tribe can request seeds for their gardens or to plant in community gardens, which the Cherokee have set up as well.</p>
                                    <p>For Baker-Oglesbee, gardening is an important part of her heritage and being a member of the Cherokee nation. It’s a tradition that has continued despite the Cherokee’s forced removal from their homeland on the East Coast to the reservation in Oklahoma during the Trail of Tears in 1838.</p>
                                    <p>“I think of gardening as a family as a way to maintain traditions of food sovereignty,” she said. “So it’s important to me that my children learn to gardening with me as I learned to garden with my grandparents and parents.”</p>
                                    <p>In addition to the seed bank, the tribal government also provides commodities to enrolled members in need of assistance. However, unlike the commodities provided by the federal government, the tribal commodities contain foods that are traditional to the Cherokee: fresh meats and produce that are sourced from the reservation lands. The program is <a href="http://webtest2.cherokee.org/Services/Human-Services/Family-Assistance/Food-Distribution">funded through the Cherokee Nation and the federal government, according to the tribal website.</a></p>
                                    <p>Though the food sovereignty programs from the Bad River Ojibwe and the Cherokee Nation are vastly different, they both have similar goals: revitalizing the cultures of each nation, and combatting the problems caused by food insecurity and food deserts.</p>
                                    <p>“I think it’s all about decolonizing your mind,” Jennings said. “Getting away from that really narrow-minded framework of what we see food as these days to bringing it back to life.”</p>

                                    <p><em>These stories were originally published on<a href="https://www.washingtonian.com/2020/11/04/dc-police-said-proud-boys-were-stabbed-on-election-night-then-they-changed-their-story/"><em> Washingtonian.com </em> </a> on November 4, 2020, and November 5, 2020, respectively.</em></p>
                                    <p class="mb-5">Early Wednesday morning, <a href="https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/local/dc/proud-boys-stabbed-in-dc-election-night/65-253da8a4-9ef8-4ef0-b5a3-7696922127dd">WUSA</a> and <a href="https://wjla.com/news/local/proud-boys-stabbed-black-lives-matter-group-dc-police">WJLA</a> reported that the DC police said three members of the white nationalist group Proud Boys were stabbed by three people “associated” with Black Lives Matter on New York Avenue early Wednesday morning.</p>

<p>However, an hour later, the two news outlets updated their stories to say that the police had retracted the earlier statements, saying that there was no evidence that the suspects were affiliated with Black Lives Matter and that the victims were not members of Proud Boys.</p>

<p>A police source close to the investigation says that the difficulty began because the officer responding at the scene filed an unclear and poorly written incident report. Detectives were later dispatched to reinterview witnesses and the victims for a new report. Police officials would not confirm whether or not this was true.</p>

<p>At the time of the initial press briefing, the source says that Lt. Ralph Neal, the officer giving the statement, was working off of the faulty incident report and reports from unnamed sources in the Police Department, who said that the victims were members of the Proud Boys. That was later found to be untrue, as officers re-interviewed the victims. It is unclear why police believed the victims were Proud Boys.</p>

<p>The source also claims that Neal was misquoted by reporters and in fact said that the suspects were not associated with Black Lives Matter. WUSA station manager Michael Valentine tells <em>Washingtonian</em> the station quoted the police accurately. A representative of WJLA has not yet replied to <em>Washingtonian</em>'s request for comment. The police source says that the victims of the incident stated that they were not attacked by people associated with Black Lives Matter.</p>

<p>The DC chapter of Black Lives Matter quickly responded to the initial report on <a href="https://twitter.com/DMVBlackLives/status/1323960948416151553?s=20">Twitter</a>, saying that no one from that movement was involved in the incident. <a href="https://twitter.com/TonyPerkinsFMTV/status/1323964825110749186?s=20">Tweets</a> from both TV news outlets later disappeared.</p>

<p>All three victims sustained minor injuries. In a press conference Wednesday, DC Police Chief Newsham said that the motive for the stabbing is not known, but if it is found to be political, the incident will be considered a hate crime.</p>
<h5>DC Black Lives Matter Accuses Police of "Disinformation That Emboldens White Supremacists"</h5>
<p>Yesterday, two TV news outlets reported that the DC police said that three people “associated” with Black Lives Matter had stabbed three members of Proud Boys, a white nationalist group. However, an hour later, the police retracted that claim, saying that neither affiliation could be verified.</p>

<p>In response, the DC chapter of Black Lives Matter issued a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTMnExz6fl6dvfm1VVrtM1pw3w25AFunbsfDivMJ6IhDUe_Jk011I4QfM6KSm8gnp8GmlmyYSGYHx_0/pub">statement</a> Wednesday night, calling the accusation an “intentional spread of disinformation that emboldens white supremacists and undermines our movement.” In the statement, they demanded a retraction of the “lie” that Black Lives Matter was involved in the incident and called for an investigation into election night violence that they said was caused by white supremacist groups.</p>

<p>While the DC police have yet to comment on the statement, they told <em>Washingtonian</em> Thursday that they had no new information to release regarding the stabbing incident. As <em>Washingtonian</em> reported previously, a police source close to the investigation says that Lt. Ralph Neal, the police officer who gave the initial press briefing, was misquoted by reporters when they said the MPD believed the suspects to be “associated” with Black Lives Matter. Michael Valentine, station manager at WUSA, says that his station quoted the police accurately. WJLA still hasn't responded to <em>Washingtonian</em>’s request for comment.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-5"><em>This story was originally published on NorthbyNorthwestern.com on February 20, 2018.</em></p>
                                    <p>Protests on campus that broke out last spring following an Immigrations and Customs Enforcement officer’s presence on campus provided the common ground that two unlikely student groups needed to join forces. Today, the Asian Pacific American Collective (APAC) and Movimiento Estudiantil Chicanx de Aztlán de Northwestern (MEChA de Northwestern) have come together to form the Latinx Asian American Collective, a group that is working to create Asian American Studies and Latino/Latina Studies departments.</p>
                                    <p>“The beginnings of the Collective were actually in the aftermath of the ICE protest that happened, because MEChA was definitely in hot water with that,” said Jessica Wang, a Weinberg junior and a member of the Collective. “Our organizations have always supported each other, I think, but there hasn’t been nearly this level of collaboration and getting to know each other on a personal level.”</p>
                                    <p>Currently, Asian American Studies and Latino/Latina Studies are both “programs,” which means they cannot hire their own faculty and have lower budgets than departments. Both fields have majors and minors, but remain programs. Some comparable fields, such as African-American studies, have their own departments.</p>

                                    <p>Not having the power to hire their own faculty severely limits the Latino/Latina Studies and Asian American Studies programs, according to Frances Aparicio, director of the Latino/Latina Studies program.</p>
                                    <p>“Part of the challenge we face as a program is that our faculty teach in departments and, based on the needs of their departments, they tell us what they are going to teach,” Aparicio said. According to Aparicio, depending on individual faculty members means the programs have little control over their curricula.</p>
                                    <p>Budget limitations are also an issue. According to the Latinx Asian American Collective’s proposal, the budget for Asian American Studies did not change between 2004 and 2017, and Latino/Latina Studies has had the same budget since 2011, despite an increase in the number of students in both programs since then. The budget deficit requires faculty to fundraise for academic events they want, according to the Collective.</p>
                                    <p>While Asian American Studies only added a major in 2016, at the end of the 2016-2017 school year, two students graduated with the major. Since the creation of the Latino/Latina Studies major in 2009, the number of students in the major has increased by 35 students.</p>
                                    <p>The Collective is also calling for Latino/Latina Studies to be changed to “Latinx Studies” in order to make the academic field more gender-inclusive.</p>
                                    <p>“The first reason [to change the name] is to recognize that there are people who cannot be categorized within the binary of Western gender logic,” said Weinberg sophomore Seri Lee, a member of the Collective. “Another reason is to get away from the Western binary of gender.”</p>
                                    <p>In fact, many students and faculty say one of the reasons they value Latino/Latina Studies and Asian American Studies is because the programs—and ethnic studies fields in general—question the institutions that make up our society.</p>
                                    <p>“A lot of the work that we do in [ethnic studies] is question the very paradigms of institutions, like Northwestern,” said Nitasha Sharma, director of the Asian American Studies program. “Students, more and more, find a real important relevance in ethnic studies, especially in this time, when they don’t understand how undocumented children can be sent home or Muslims can be banned. People want to understand these processes, and you can often sort through them in ethnic studies classes.”</p>
                                    <p>According to Sharma, ethnic studies classes tell a different version of history from the perspective of marginalized communities, whose voices are often left out of the predominant historical narrative. Looking at history from a different perspective allows students to think more critically about the world around them.</p>
                                    <p>“Ethnic studies teaches you how to think. It teaches you how to examine history and really criticize the narrative you’re given,” said Wang. “Especially in this current political moment, it helps you to understand that what’s happening now did not come out of nowhere. There’s a multiple-centuries-long history that has allowed everything that’s happening to unfold.”</p>
                                    <p>Moving forward, the Collective hopes to gain more support for their campaign. On February 7, they held a “teach-in” to educate other students about their campaign, which featured an online trivia game: “Are you smarter than a Weinberg administrator?” They have also been circulating a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfzggNlm3qdz9-8rmedx4ndRhPUqnPmXjVmVnCbYZAC0ONS8Q/viewform">petition</a> since January, which currently has over 1,200 signatures. They are also trying to reach out to alumni and faculty members from their programs for support.</p>
                                    <p>“We’re trying to make this push more legitimate and make our voices heard by the administration,” said Weinberg sophomore June Choe, a member of the Collective. “After that, we have a lot of plans on our proposal for implementation timelines.”</p>
                                    <p>ASG has also endorsed their campaign, saying in a statement that the programs “serve essential roles” on campus. Other student groups, such as the Rainbow Alliance and For Members Only, have also voiced their support for the campaign. Eventually, the Collective plans to meet with Weinberg administrators to discuss implementing a timeline for establishing the departments.</p>
                                    <p>For now, members of the Collective are working to raise awareness about the importance of ethnic studies. They’ve created two social media campaigns, <a href="https://twitter.com/tobedepartments/status/963115962617729031">#aasptaughtme </a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/tobedepartments/status/963950141114929152">#llsptaughtme</a>, that feature testimonials about what students learned in both Asian American Studies and Latino/Latina Studies here at Northwestern.</p>
                                    <p>“I’m an Asian American Studies major not because I want to learn about Asian Americans,” Wang said. “If you don’t understand how Asian Americans have played a role in history then you just don’t understand history. Period."</p>
